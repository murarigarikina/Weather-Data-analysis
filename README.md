# Weather Data Analysis using Python

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of historical weather data
to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between key meteorological variables.

The goal of this project is to analyze past weather information such as temperature,
precipitation, wind speed, and weather conditions to extract meaningful insights
using data visualization and statistical analysis.
